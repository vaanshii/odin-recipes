Hello, this is my first lesson on foundational course on Odin Project.
Today, I learned about how to use GitHub, primarily on how to create and use repositories and commit.

I also learned how to use bash commands to navigate through GitHub by using repositories and cloning them into my local drive.

I'm really looking forward to this learning journey on web development!

Note to my future self:
This is me, starting my web-dev career.(?) I still don't know the career path that I will take. Don't spoil me.
