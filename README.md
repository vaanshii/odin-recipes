# odin-recipes

Hello, this is my first lesson on foundational course on Odin Project.
Today, I learned about how to use GitHub, primarily on how to create and use repositories and commit.

I also learned how to use bash commands to navigate through GitHub by using repositories and cloning them into my local drive.

I'm really looking forward to this learning journey on web development!

Update: So, it seems that I've started my lesson in a wrong starting point (I started on Git Commits) that's why It's so confusing when I first started, but now I managed to progress here in the last part of HTML Introduction and now I will be working on my first Project: Recipes.

Note to my future self:
This is me, starting my web-dev career.(?) I still don't know the career path that I will take. Don't spoil me.
